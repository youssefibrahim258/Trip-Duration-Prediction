##  Project Overview
The **Trip Duration Predictor** is designed to predict the duration of taxi rides by analyzing various features such as geographic coordinates, time of day, and other relevant factors. By leveraging machine learning techniques, particularly **Ridge regression**, the project examines historical trip data to uncover patterns, enabling accurate predictions of trip durations in future scenarios.

##  Data Cleaning
The first step involved addressing outliers to ensure data quality. Removing or handling these outliers helped improve the model’s accuracy and made the data more consistent.

##  Feature Engineering
The dataset included geographical data such as longitude and latitude. I created new features like Haversine distance, Manhattan distance, and direction, which significantly improved the model's predictive power.

##  Cluster Feature Extraction
I utilized the **MiniBatchKMeans** algorithm to cluster pickup and dropoff coordinates into 'n' groups. This clustering allowed me to add new features such as **pickup_cluster** and **dropoff_cluster** to the dataset.

##  Data Visualization
I performed data visualization to explore categorical data and identify patterns and trends. For numeric data, I discovered that it followed a right-skewed distribution, which led me to apply a log transformation to better understand and analyze the data.

##  Data Transformation
Using **ColumnTransformer**, I applied **OneHotEncoder** for categorical features and **StandardScaler** for numeric features. Additionally, I created new time-based features from datetime columns, such as extracting the **day** and **hour** from timestamps.

##  Machine Learning Model
I developed a machine learning model using a **Pipeline** that combines:
- **ColumnTransformer** for preprocessing
- **PolynomialFeatures** (degree 2) for feature interaction
- **Ridge regression** with an alpha value of 50 to ensure optimal model performance

This pipeline enhances the model's generalization ability, providing better predictions and more stable results.
